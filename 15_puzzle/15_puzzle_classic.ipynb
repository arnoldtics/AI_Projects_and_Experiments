    "The 15 puzzle, a classic tile-sliding challenge, boasts countless variations of the \"solved\" state. I'm focusing on the iconic arrangement pictured above, where tiles 1 through 15 slide across a 4x4 grid, leaving one space vacant.\n",

    "The rules are straightforward: move any tile adjacent to the empty space into it. In the solved state, for example, you can swap the 15 rightward or the 12 downward.\n",
