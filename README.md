# AI_Projects_and_Experiments
My personal projects, experiments and school practices about AI (general AI course, ML, and DL).

## Description
This repository contains artificial intelligence projects and experiments that I developed in my university courses. Also includes some personal projects and experiments that I developed on my own. Due to my university courses were taken in Spanish, some of the notebooks and scripts were written in Spanish. So feel free to ask any questions.
