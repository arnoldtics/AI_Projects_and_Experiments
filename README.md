# AI_Projects_and_Experiments
My personal projects, experiments and school practices about AI (general AI course, ML, and DL).

## Description
This repository contains artificial intelligence projects and experiments that I developed in my university courses. Also includes some personal projects and experiments that I developed on my own. Due to my university courses were taken in Spanish, some of the notebooks and scripts were written in Spanish. So feel free to ask any questions.

## List of Projects  

### Machine Learning: Supervised Learning Final Project  
[View Project](ML_Supervised_Learning_ML_Class_Project)  
- Implemented traditional machine learning algorithms and combined them into an **ensemble model**.  
- Compared ensemble learning methods using diverse evaluation metrics.  
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning for each component of bagging ensembles to optimize performance.  

### Machine Learning Metrics and Cross-Validation  
[View Project](ML_Metrics_And_Cross_Validation)  
- Deployed multiple classification algorithms, including **decision trees**, **k-NN**, **Naive Bayes**, **logistic regression**, and **support vector machines**.  
- Optimized models to maximize key metrics such as **accuracy**, **recall**, **precision**, and **F1-score**.  
- Utilized cross-validation to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.  
- Conducted metric-driven decision-making to select the best model for specific use cases.  

### Machine Learning Certificate: Unsupervised Learning Project  
[View Project](ML_Certificate_Practice_KMeans_KMedoids)  
- Applied **K-Means** and **K-Medoids** clustering algorithms for client segmentation.  

### Machine Learning Certificate: Logistic Regression Project  
[View Project](ML_Certificate_Practice_Logistic_Regresion)  
- Developed a logistic regression model to classify Uber and Lyft users in Boston.  

### Machine Learning Certificate: k-Nearest Neighbors Project  
[View Project](ML_Certificate_Practice_KNN)  
- Implemented the **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm to classify water deposits using real data from the state government.  

### Machine Learning Certificate: Decision Tree Project  
[View Project](ML_Certificate_Practice_Decision_Tree_Clasification)  
- Built a decision tree model to classify social media platform users into distinct age groups.  

### 15 Puzzle Solver  
[View Project](15_puzzle)  
- Utilized the **A\*** algorithm with traditional heuristics to solve the 15-puzzle problem efficiently.
